# Fine-grained Entity Recognition (FgER)

This repository contains the code and data to reproduce the experiments of the paper "[Fine-grained Entity Recognition with Reduced False Negatives and Large Type Coverage](https://openreview.net/forum?id=HylHE-9p6m)".


There are three sections of the repository:
1. [Datasets (Wiki-FbF, Wiki-FbT and 1k-WFB-g) along with the preprocessed Wikipedia and Freebase.](https://github.com/abhipec/HAnDS/tree/master/datasets)
2. [The code used to generate the dataset, i.e., the HAnDS framework code.](https://github.com/abhipec/HAnDS/tree/master/src/HAnDS)
3. [The code related to the learning models.](https://github.com/abhipec/HAnDS/tree/master/src/models)
